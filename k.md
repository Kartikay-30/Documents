1. #  **Introduction**<a id="introduction"></a>

- Shell Scripting consists of a set of commands to perform a task.

- All commands execute sequentially.

- Tasks like file manipulation, program execution, user interaction, automation of tasks etc can be done by Shell Scripting.


## Definition of Bash scripting<a id="definition-of-bash-scripting"></a>

- A bash script is a file containing a sequence of commands that are executed by the bash program line by line. It allows us to perform a series of actions, such as navigating to a specific directory, creating a folder, and launching a process using the command line.

* By saving these commands in a script, we can repeat the same sequence of steps multiple times and execute them by running the script.

2. #  **Advantages of Bash scripting**<a id="advantages-of-bash-scripting"></a>

- ## **Automation**<a id="automation"></a>

* It allows us to automate repetitive task and processes, saving time and reducing the risk of errors that can occur with manual execution.

- ## **Portability**<a id="portability"></a>

* Shell scripts can run on various platforms and operating systems, like UNIX, Linux, macOS, and even Windows through the use of emulators or virtual machines.

- ## **Flexibility**<a id="flexibility"></a>

* Shell scripts are highly customizable and can be easily modified to suit specific requirements. 

- They can also be combined with other programming languages or utilities to create more powerful scripts.

* ## **Accessibility**<a id="accessibility"></a>

- Shell scripts are easy to write and don't require any special tools or software. 

* They can be edited using any text editor like ( nano,vim,vi ), and most operating systems have a built-in shell interpreter.

- ## **Integration**<a id="integration"></a>

* Shell scripts can be integrated with other tools and applications, such as databases, web servers, and cloud services, allowing for more complex automation and system management tasks.

- ## **Debugging**<a id="debugging"></a>

* Shell scripts are easy to debug, and most shells have built-in debugging and error-reporting tools that can help identify and fix issues quickly.
