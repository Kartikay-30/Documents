# 1.   **Introduction**<a id="introduction"></a>

- Shell Scripting consists of a set of commands to perform a task.

- All commands execute sequentially.

- Tasks like file manipulation, program execution, user interaction, automation of tasks etc can be done by Shell Scripting.


## Definition of Bash scripting<a id="definition-of-bash-scripting"></a>

- BASH stands for **Bourne Again SHell**
- A bash script is a file containing a sequence of commands that are executed by the bash program line by line. It allows us to perform a series of actions, such as navigating to a specific directory, creating a folder, and launching a process using the command line.

* By saving these commands in a script, we can repeat the same sequence of steps multiple times and execute them by running the script.

# 2.   **Advantages of Bash scripting**<a id="advantages-of-bash-scripting"></a>

 ## a) **Automation**<a id="automation"></a>

* It allows us to automate repetitive task and processes, saving time and reducing the risk of errors that can occur with manual execution.

## b) **Portability**<a id="portability"></a>

* Shell scripts can run on various platforms and operating systems, like UNIX, Linux, macOS, and even Windows through the use of emulators or virtual machines.

 ## c) **Flexibility**<a id="flexibility"></a>

* Shell scripts are highly customizable and can be easily modified to suit specific requirements. 

- They can also be combined with other programming languages or utilities to create more powerful scripts.

## d) **Accessibility**<a id="accessibility"></a>

- Shell scripts are easy to write and don't require any special tools or software. 

* They can be edited using any text editor like ( nano,vim,vi ), and most operating systems have a built-in shell interpreter.

 ## e) **Integration**<a id="integration"></a>

* Shell scripts can be integrated with other tools and applications, such as databases, web servers, and cloud services, allowing for more complex automation and system management tasks.

 ## f) **Debugging**<a id="debugging"></a>

* Shell scripts are easy to debug, and most shells have built-in debugging and error-reporting tools that can help identify and fix issues quickly.

# 3.   **How to Get Started with Bash Scripting**<a id="how-to-get-started-with-bash-scripting"></a>
To start a Bash script in Linux, we need to follow these general steps:

1. Create a Bash script: Use a text editor, such as `nano`, `vim`, or `gedit`, to create a new file and write your Bash script. For example:
``` 
       nano myscript.sh
```
   Inside the editor, write your script. Here's a simple example:
```       
       #!/bin/bash
       echo "Hello, World!"
```
   Save the file and exit the text editor.

2. Make the script executable: You need to make the script executable to run it. Use the `chmod` command to do this:
```
       chmod +x myscript.sh
```
3. Run the script: We can execute the script by typing its name preceded by `bash` in the terminal:
```
       bash myscript.sh
```
   This assumes that the script is in the current directory. If it's in a different directory, we need to provide the full or relative path.


Keep in mind that the first line (`#!/bin/bash`) is called a **SHEBANG**, and it specifies the interpreter (in this case, Bash) to be used to run the script. It's necessary for the script to be interpreted correctly.
*****************************************************************

# :- **Here are some Bash Shell Script code :-**

i) **Basic code**

```
 nano basic.sh
```
```
#!/bin/bash

echo "what is the number ?"
read k
echo "The number is :-" $k 
```
**OUTPUT**

```
 bash basic.sh
```
***
what is the number ?

23

The number is :- 23
***
**NOTE ➖**

- `echo` command is used to print the statement.

- `read` command is used to enter the value.

- `$` means to find a specific value that we enter with the help of the read command.

- To run the program we have to write “**bash filename.sh**”, here `.sh` is the extension to run the program.
*******************************
*******************************
*******************************
ii) **Conditional Statement**

```
 nano condition.sh
```
```
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter the number"

read num

if [ $num -lt 1000 ];

    then

echo "Number is correct"

    else

echo "Number is incorrect"

fi
```
**OUTPUT**

```
 bash condition.sh
```
***
Enter the number

12345

**Number is incorrect**
```
 bash condition.sh
```
Enter the number

123

**Number is correct**

*******************************
*******************************
*******************************
iii) **OR (`||`) Operator**
```
nano or.sh
```
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Now enter the details of user"

echo "Enter the username"

read user

echo "Enter the password"

read pass

if [[ ( $user == "Kartikay" || $pass == "301224") ]];

    then

echo "user is valid"

    else

echo "user is invalid"

    fi
```
**OUTPUT**
```
bash or.sh
```
****
Now enter the details of user

Enter the username

Kartik

Enter the password

301224

**user is valid**
```
bash or.sh
```
Now enter the details of user

Enter the username

kartikay

Enter the password

301224

**user is valid**

****
****
****

iv) **AND (`&`) Operator**
```
 nano and.sh
```
```
#!/bin/bash

echo "Now enter the details of user"
echo "Enter the username"
read user

echo "Enter the password"
read pass

if [[ ( $user == "Kartikay" && $pass == "301224") ]];

    then

echo "user is valid"

    else

echo "user is invalid"

fi
```
**OUTPUT**

```
 bash and.sh
```
***
Now enter the details of user

Enter the username

kartikay

Enter the password

301224

**user is invalid**
```
 bash and.sh
```
Now enter the details of user

Enter the username

Kartikay

Enter the password

301224

**user is valid**

v) **CASE Option**
```
 nano case.sh
```
```
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter the assigned Single digit no. to check Employee details"

read val
case $val in

echo "Name – Vishal Emp ID – 104 ";;
5)
echo "Name – Aman  Emp ID – 105 ";;
*)
echo "Sorry! Invalid choice";;
esac
```
**OUTPUT**
**********
```
 bash case.sh
```

**Name – Ramesh  Emp ID – 103**
```
 bash case.sh
```
Enter the assigned Single digit no. to check Employee details

**\***

  **Sorry! Invalid choice**

vi) **Looping** 

This is a process in which all the statements will run till condition is true

**(a) For Loop**
```
nano loop.sh
```
```
#!/bin/bash

for (( count==0; count<10; count++; ))

do

echo $count

done
```

```
#!/bin/bash

counter=1

while [ $counter -le 7 ]

do

    echo $counter

    ((counter++))

done

# **To search file with the help of scripting**

```
nano search.sh
```
```
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter the file name you want to search"

read name

if [ -f $name ];

   then

echo "File is exists"

   else

echo "File does not exists"

fi
```
**Note ➖**

- Here `f` helps to find the file from our system

**OUTPUT**
```
bash search.sh
```
Enter the file name you want to search

kaushik

**File is exists**
```
bash search.sh
```
Enter the file name you want to search

kartik

**File does not exists**

**Note ➖**

- Remember that file must already exist in your system.
